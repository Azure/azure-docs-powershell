# Get started with Azure PowerShell cmdlets

This guide is the introduction to the Cmdlet Reference for Windows Azure PowerShell.
In it, you’ll find everything you need to get up and running quickly with the cmdlets.


## Start

To use these cmdlets, you should have a good understanding of PowerShell and how it works.
And experience with Microsoft Azure, since the cmdlets you will use perform the same functions available through the portal GUI.

You’ll also need to know basic PowerShell scripting techniques since this guide doesn’t teach you how to script, but instead shows you how to use the cmdlets to automate common IT administration tasks.

If you are new to Azure, see [the Azure documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/#).

If you need to brush up on PowerShell before you get started, see [Scripting with Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx).

## About Azure cmdlets

The cmdlets automate Azure so you can get mundane, repetitive IT admin tasks done quickly and easily.
To learn how, watch this video: [Take Control of the Cloud with the Windows Azure PowerShell Cmdlets](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/WAD-B305#fbid=).

There are two versions of the cmdlets available: [1.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt619274.aspx) and [0.9.8](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt617088.aspx).

If you are getting started, you should use version 1.0.
Version 0.9.8 is provided for backward compatibility.

There are two sets of modules in each version: Service Management (SM) and Resource Manager (RM).
If you are getting started, you should use the RM modules.
To learn why, see [Deprecation of Switch AzureMode in Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/wiki/Deprecation-of-Switch-AzureMode-in-Azure-PowerShell).

To learn more about Resource Manager, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/).
