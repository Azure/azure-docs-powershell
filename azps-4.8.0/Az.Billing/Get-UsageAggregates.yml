  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.Azure.Commerce.UsageAggregates.Models.AggregationGranularity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AggregationGranularity
  description: |+
    Specifies the aggregation precision of the data.
    Valid values are: Daily and Hourly.
    The default value is Daily.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Daily, Hourly
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ContinuationToken
  description: |+
    Specifies the continuation token that was retrieved from the response body in the previous call.
    For a large result set, responses are paged by using continuation tokens.
    The continuation token serves as a bookmark for progress.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the data is retrieved from the beginning of the day or hour specified in *ReportedStartTime*.
    We recommend that you follow the next link in the response to page though the data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Common.Authentication.Abstractions.Core.IAzureContextContainer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DefaultProfile
  description: |+
    The credentials, account, tenant, and subscription used for communication with azure.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: AzContext, AzureRmContext, AzureCredential
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReportedEndTime
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the reported end time for when resource usage was recorded in the Azure billing system.
    Azure is a distributed system, spanning multiple datacenters around the world, so there is a delay between when the resource was actually consumed, which is the resource usage time, and when the usage event reached the billing system, which is the resource usage reported time.
    In order to get all usage events for a subscription that are reported for a time period, you query by reported time.
    Even though you query by reported time, the cmdlet aggregates the response data by the resource usage time.
    The resource usage data is the useful pivot for analyzing the data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReportedStartTime
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the reported start time for when resource usage was recorded in the Azure billing system.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ShowDetails
  description: |+
    Indicates whether this cmdlet returns instance-level details with the usage data.
    The default value is $True.
    If $False, the service aggregates the results on the server side, and therefore returns fewer aggregate groups.
    For example, if you are running three websites, by default you will get three line items for website consumption.
    However, when the value is $False, all the data for the same **subscriptionId**, **meterId**, **usageStartTime**, and **usageEndTime** is collapsed into a single line item.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Az.Billing.Get-UsageAggregates
name: Get-UsageAggregates
description: |-
  The **Get-UsageAggregates** cmdlet gets aggregated Azure subscription usage data by the following properties: 
  - Start and end times of when the usage was reported.
  - Aggregation precision, either daily or hourly.
  - Instance level detail for multiple instances of the same resource.
  For consistent results, the returned data is based on when the usage details were reported by the Azure resource.
