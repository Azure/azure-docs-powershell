- title: 'Example 1: Add a public IP as the front-end IP address'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$PublicIp = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" -Name "PublicIp01" -location "West US" -AllocationMethod Dynamic
    PS C:\> $AppGw = Get-AzApplicationGateway -Name "ApplicationGateway01" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
    PS C:\> $AppGw = Add-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig -ApplicationGateway $AppGw -Name "FrontEndIp01" -PublicIPAddress $PublicIp
  description: |-
    The first command creates a public IP address object and stores it in the $PublicIp variable.
    The second command gets the application gateway named ApplicationGateway01 that belongs to the resource group named ResourceGroup01, and stores it in the $AppGw variable.
    The third command adds the front-end IP configuration named FrontEndIp01, for the gateway in $AppGw, using the address stored in $PublicIp.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Add a static private IP as the front-end IP address'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$VNet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name "VNet01" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
    PS C:\> $Subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "Subnet01" -VirtualNetwork $VNet
    PS C:\> $AppGw = Get-AzApplicationGateway -Name "ApplicationGateway01" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
    PS C:\> $AppGw = Add-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig -ApplicationGateway $AppGw -Name "FrontendIP02" -Subnet $Subnet -PrivateIPAddress 10.0.1.1
  description: |-
    The first command gets a virtual network named VNet01 that belongs to the resource group named ResourceGroup01, and stores it in the $VNet variable.
    The second command gets a subnet configuration named Subnet01 using $VNet from the first command and stores it in the $Subnet variable.
    The third command gets the application gateway named ApplicationGateway01 that belongs to the resource group named ResourceGroup01, and stores it in the $AppGw variable.
    The fourth command adds a front-end IP configuration named FrontendIP02 using $Subnet from the second command and the private IP address 10.0.1.1.

  code: |-

    The first command gets a virtual network named VNet01 that belongs to the resource group named ResourceGroup01, and stores it in the $VNet variable.
    The second command gets a subnet configuration named Subnet01 using $VNet from the first command and stores it in the $Subnet variable.
    The third command gets the application gateway named ApplicationGateway01 that belongs to the resource group named ResourceGroup01, and stores it in the $AppGw variable.
    The fourth command adds a front-end IP configuration named FrontendIP02 using $Subnet from the second command.

  description: |+
    Specifies the public IP address which this cmdlet adds as a front-end IP address for the application gateway.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  name: Subnet
  description: |+
    Specifies the subnet which this cmdlet adds as front-end IP configuration.
    If you specify this parameter, it implies that the application gateway supports a private IP based-configuration.
    If the *PrivateIPAddress* parameter is specified, it should belong to this subnet.
    If *PrivateIPAddress* is not specified, one of the IP addresses from this subnet is dynamically picked up as the front-end IP address of the application gateway.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SubnetId
  description: |+
    Specifies the subnet ID which this cmdlet adds as the front-end IP configuration.
    Passing subnet implies private IP.
    If the *PrivateIPAddress* parameter is specified, it should belong to this subnet.
    Otherwise, one of the IP from this subnet is dynamically picked up as the front-end IP of the application gateway.

  defaultValue: None

uid: Az.Network.Add-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig
name: Add-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig
description: |-
  The **Add-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig** cmdlet adds a front-end IP configuration to an application gateway.
  An application gateway supports two types of front-end IP configurations: 
  - Public IP addresses
  - Private IP addresses using internal load-balancing (ILB)
  An application gateway can have at most one public IP and one private IP.
  Add the public IP address and private IP address as separate front-end IPs.
